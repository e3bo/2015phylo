#' Alignment of the HA1 gene from H1N1 Swine influenza
#'
#' A dataset containing nucleotide sequence from H1N1 influenza A
#' virus sampled from swine. It was extracted from Text S3 of Nelson
#' et al. 2011,
#' "Spatial Dynamics of Human-Origin H1 Influenza A Virus in North American Swine",
#' PLoS Pathogens.
#'  
#' @format An object of class DNAbin containing 127 nucleotide
#'     sequences of length 847. The year of collection is the number
#'     at the end of the sequence name. The two-letter abbreviation at
#'     the beginning of the label is the abbreviation for the US state
#'     of collection.
