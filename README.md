This repository contains the code and writing relating to a science research project. The goal is to develop a regularized regression method for selecting predictors of geographics transitions that are consistent with the locations of a set of virus sequences and an inferred evolutionary history of those sequences. We will be applying this method to simulated data and a PEDV data set.
