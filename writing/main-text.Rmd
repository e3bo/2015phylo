Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) emerged in the United States in
2013, rapidly spread throughout much of the country, and was later
detected in neighboring Canada and Mexico [@hill2014;@efsa2014]. A
U.S. strain has been confirmed to cause severe watery diarrhea and
vomiting [@jung_pathology_2014], characteristic symptoms of
porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED). Morbidity during a PED outbreak can
be extremely high, and more than 90 percent of unweaned pigs may
die [@stevenson2013]. Those pigs that do survive have been found
to be less productive [@alvarez2015].

Greater understanding of how PEDV spreads among farms could likely
identify weak points in current control measures. That unidentified
weak points exist is clear from the occurrence of PED outbreaks
without any clear cause on farms with rigorous biosecurity
programs [@stevenson2013]. At a larger scale, although it seems
that a U.S. strain originated from a recombination of strains
circulating in China [@tian2014], the location and manner through
which PEDV was introduced into the United States remains unknown,
indicating an unidentified weak point in the nation's border security.

Genomic analyses
[@chen_isolation_2013;@hoang2013;@huang2013;@marthaler_complete_2013;@stevenson2013;@marthaler2014;@oka2014;@vlasova2014;@wang_new_2014]
have shown that several strains of PEDV are circulating in North
America. Here, we take advantage of the available sequence data to
estimate rates of interstate migration of the virus with a
phylogeographic approach as in
[@nelson2011;@lemey2014;@magee2014;@nelson2015]. A regression model is
used to relate these rates to interstate transport flows of swine, as
contamination of transport trailers has been implicated in
farm-to-farm spread [@lowe2014;@thomas2015]. We use simulation to
verify our ability to accurately estimate parameters for our assumed
model. Regarding the nature of PEDV's introduction to the United
States, we look for evidence of multiple introductions by comparing
estimated ages of common ancestors of two clades with the first known
outbreak of PEDV in the United States.
