Here, we present a Bayesian statistical inference approach to the joint estimation of mutation rate and population size that incorporates the uncertainty in the genealogy of such temporally spaced sequences by using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration. The Kingman coalescent model is used to describe the time structure of the ancestral tree. We recover information about the unknown true ancestral coalescent tree, population size, and the overall mutation rate from temporally spaced data, that is, from nucleotide sequences gathered at different times, from different individuals, in an evolving haploid population. We briefly discuss the methodological implications and show what can be inferred, in various practically relevant states of prior knowledge. We develop extensions for exponentially growing population size and joint estimation of substitution model parameters. We illustrate some of the important features of this approach on a genealogy of HIV-1 envelope (env) partial sequences.},

Since then the virus has spread rapidly nationwide and to Canada and Mexico causing high mortality among nursing piglets and significant economic losses. Currently there are no efficacious preventive measures or therapeutic tools to control PEDV in the US. The isolation of PEDV in cell culture is the first step toward the development of an attenuated vaccine, to study the biology of PEDV and to develop in vitro PEDV immunoassays, inactivation assays and screen for PEDV antivirals. In this study, nine of 88 US PEDV strains were isolated successfully on Vero cells with supplemental trypsin and subjected to genomic sequence analysis. They differed genetically mainly in the N-terminal S protein region as follows: (1) strains (n = 7) similar to the highly virulent US PEDV strains; (2) one similar to the reportedly US S INDEL PEDV strain; and (3) one novel strain most closely related to highly virulent US PEDV strains, but with a large (197 aa) deletion in the S protein. Representative strains of these three genetic groups were passaged serially and grew to titers of ∼5–6 log10 plaque forming units/mL. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the isolation in cell culture of an S INDEL PEDV strain and a PEDV strain with a large (197 aa) deletion in the S protein. We also designed primer sets to detect these genetically diverse US PEDV strains.},

Alignment quality analysis can be performed and low-scoring segments or exceptional residues can be highlighted. Quality analysis and realignment of selected residue ranges provide the user with a powerful tool to improve and refine difficult alignments and to trap errors in input sequences.

	abstract = {The use of some multiple-sequence alignments in phylogenetic analysis, particularly those that are not very well conserved, requires the elimination of poorly aligned positions and divergent regions, since they may not be homologous or may have been saturated by multiple substitutions. A computerized method that eliminates such positions and at the same time tries to minimize the loss of informative sites is presented here. The method is based on the selection of blocks of positions that fulfill a simple set of requirements with respect to the number of contiguous conserved positions, lack of gaps, and high conservation of flanking positions, making the final alignment more suitable for phylogenetic analysis. To illustrate the efficiency of this method, alignments of 10 mitochondrial proteins from several completely sequenced mitochondrial genomes belonging to diverse eukaryotes were used as examples. The percentages of removed positions were higher in the most divergent alignments. After removing divergent segments, the amino acid composition of the different sequences was more uniform, and pairwise distances became much smaller. Phylogenetic trees show that topologies can be different after removing conserved blocks, particularly when there are several poorly resolved nodes. Strong support was found for the grouping of animals and fungi but not for the position of more basal eukaryotes. The use of a computerized method such as the one presented here reduces to a certain extent the necessity of manually editing multiple alignments, makes the automation of phylogenetic analysis of large data sets feasible, and facilitates the reproduction of the final alignment by other researchers.},

	abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis ({TB}) is one of the most complex, persistent and controversial problems facing the British cattle industry, costing the country an estimated £100 million per year. The low sensitivity of the standard diagnostic test leads to considerable ambiguity in determining the main transmission routes of infection, which exacerbates the continuing scientific debate. In turn this uncertainty fuels the fierce public and political disputes on the necessity of controlling badgers to limit the spread of infection. Here we present a dynamic stochastic spatial model for bovine {TB} in Great Britain that combines within-farm and between-farm transmission. At the farm scale the model incorporates stochastic transmission of infection, maintenance of infection in the environment and a testing protocol that mimics historical government policy. Between-farm transmission has a short-range environmental component and is explicitly driven by movements of individual cattle between farms, as recorded in the Cattle Tracing System. The resultant model replicates the observed annual increase of infection over time as well as the spread of infection into new areas. Given that our model is mechanistic, it can ascribe transmission pathways to each new case; the majority of newly detected cases involve several transmission routes with moving infected cattle, reinfection from an environmental reservoir and poor sensitivity of the diagnostic test all having substantive roles. This underpins our findings on the implications of control measures. Very few of the control options tested have the potential to reverse the observed annual increase, with only intensive strategies such as whole-herd culling or additional national testing proving highly effective, whereas controls focused on a single transmission route are unlikely to be highly effective.},

Simulation models were developed to assess the impact of livestock herd types and vaccination on foot and mouth disease ({FMD}) outbreaks using the North American Animal Disease Spread Model. In this study, potential {FMD} virus outbreaks in the central region of the U.S. were simulated to compare different vaccination strategies to a depopulation only scenario. Based on data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service, a simulated population of 151,620 livestock operations characterized by latitude and longitude, production type, and herd size was generated. For the simulations, a single 17,000 head feedlot was selected as the initial latently infected herd in an otherwise susceptible population. Direct and indirect contact rates between herds were based on survey data of livestock producers in Kansas and Colorado. Control methods included ring vaccination around infected herds. Feedlots ≥3000 head were either the only production type that was vaccinated or were assigned the highest vaccination priority. Simulated vaccination scenarios included low and high vaccine capacity, vaccination zones of 10 km or 50 km around detected infected premises, and vaccination trigger of 10 or 100 detected infected herds. Probability of transmission following indirect contact, movement controls and contact rate parameters were considered uncertain and so were the subjects of sensitivity analysis. All vaccination scenarios decreased number of herds depopulated but not all decreased outbreak duration. Increased size of the vaccination zone during an outbreak decreased the length of the outbreak and number of herds destroyed. Increased size of the vaccination zone primarily resulted in vaccinating feedlots ≥3000 head across a larger area. Increasing the vaccination capacity had a smaller impact on the outbreak and may not be feasible if vaccine production and delivery is limited. The ability to vaccinate all the production types surrounding an infected herd did not appear as beneficial as priority vaccination of feedlot production types that have high numbers of indirect contacts. Outbreak duration, number of herds depopulated and the effectiveness of vaccination were sensitive to indirect contact transmission probability and movement restrictions. The results of this study will provide information about the impacts of disease control protocols which may be useful in choosing the optimal control methods to meet the goals of rapid effective control and eradication.},

	abstract = {Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases of zoonotic origin like highly pathogenic avian influenza pose a significant threat to human and animal health due to their elevated transmissibility. Identifying the drivers of such viruses is challenging, and estimation of spatial diffusion is complicated by the fact that the variability of viral spread from locations could be caused by a complex array of unknown factors. Several techniques exist to help identify these drivers, including bioinformatics, phylogeography, and spatial epidemiology, but these methods are generally evaluated separately and do not consider the complementary nature of each other. Here, we studied an approach that integrates these techniques and identifies the most important drivers of viral spread by focusing on H5N1 influenza A virus in Egypt because of its recent emergence as an epicenter for the disease. We used a Bayesian phylogeographic generalized linear model ({GLM}) to reconstruct spatiotemporal patterns of viral diffusion while simultaneously assessing the impact of factors contributing to transmission. We also calculated the cross-species transmission rates among hosts in order to identify the species driving transmission. The densities of both human and avian species were supported contributors, along with latitude, longitude, elevation, and several meteorological variables. Also supported was the presence of a genetic motif found near the hemagglutinin cleavage site. Various genetic, geographic, demographic, and environmental predictors each play a role in H1N1 diffusion. Further development and expansion of phylogeographic {GLMs} such as this will enable health agencies to identify variables that can curb virus diffusion and reduce morbidity and mortality.},

Reconstructions of evolutionary history from pathogen gene sequences offer qualitative descriptions of spatial spread, but current approaches are poorly equipped to formally test and quantify the contribution of different potential explanatory factors, such as human mobility and demography. Here, we use a novel phylogeographic method to evaluate multiple potential predictors of viral spread in human influenza dynamics. We identify air travel as the predominant driver of global influenza migration, whilst also revealing the contribution of other mobility processes at more local scales. We demonstrate the power of our inter-disciplinary approach by using it to predict the global pandemic expansion of H1N1 influenza in 2009. Our study highlights the importance of integrating evolutionary and ecological information when studying the dynamics of infectious disease.},

In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a `{DevOps}' philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.},

	abstract = {Transmission is the driving force in the dynamics of any infectious disease. A crucial element in understanding disease dynamics, therefore, is the ‘transmission term’ describing the rate at which susceptible hosts are ‘converted’ into infected hosts by their contact with infectious material. Recently, the conventional form of this term has been increasingly questioned, and new terminologies and conventions have been proposed. Here, therefore, we review the derivation of transmission terms, explain the basis of confusion, and provide clarification. The root of the problem has been a failure to include explicit consideration of the area occupied by a host population, alongside both the number of infectious hosts and their density within the population. We argue that the terms ‘density-dependent transmission’ and ‘frequency-dependent transmission’ remain valid and useful (though a ‘fuller’ transmission term for the former is identified), but that the terms ‘mass action’, ‘true mass action’ and ‘pseudo mass action’ are all unhelpful and should be dropped. Also, contrary to what has often been assumed, the distinction between homogeneous and heterogeneous mixing in a host population is orthogonal to the distinction between density- and frequency-dependent transmission modes.},

Pigs inoculated with the two doses of the attenuated virus did not show any typical sign of the disease, and virus shedding was not frequent. In contrast, 31\% of pigs exposed to the virulent {PEDV} developed diarrhoea and virus shedding was demonstrated in 100\%. At different postinoculation day ({PID}) and postchallenge day ({PCD}) virus-specific antibody-secreting cells ({ASC}) in gut associated lymphoid tissues (duodenum and ileum lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes) and systemic locations (blood and spleen) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunospot ({ELISPOT}). Only a small response was detected in the groups inoculated with attenuated {PEDV}, whereas in the group previously exposed to the virulent virus on {PID} 21 a large number of {IgG} and {IgA} {ASC} was detected. Isotype-specific antibody responses in serum were investigated by {ELISA}. {IgG} responses were detected in all groups, although the highest response corresponded to the group inoculated with virulent virus and only this group showed an {IgA} response. The pigs exposed to virulent {PEDV} were completely protected against the challenge with a higher dose of the same virulent virus on {PID} 21 and none of them shed the virus. The pigs inoculated with the attenuated strain were partially protected against the challenge, and 25\% of the low dose- and 50\% of the high dose-exposed pigs did not shed virus after challenge. All the pigs from a control group, not previously exposed to the virus, excreted the virus in faeces. A strong positive correlation was established between protection and the {ASC} responses detected in gut associated lymphoid tissues and blood at the challenge day and also between protection and serum isotype-specific antibody titers on that day. In addition, the {IgA} and {IgG} {ASC} responses detected in the blood on {PID} 21 also correlated with the responses found in the gut associated lymphoid tissues. The {ASC} and serum antibody responses after the challenge corresponded to a secondary immune response in the groups inoculated with attenuated virus, whereas a primary response was evident in the control group. No increase was seen in any of the parameters studied in the pigs inoculated with virulent {PEDV}.},

	abstract = {Before the development of mass-vaccination campaigns, measles exhibited persistent fluctuations (endemic dynamics) in large British cities, and recurrent outbreaks (episodic dynamics) in smaller communities. The critical community size separating the two regimes was ∼300 000–500 000. We develop a model, the {TSIR} (Time-series Susceptible–Infected–Recovered) model, that can capture both endemic cycles and episodic outbreaks in measles. The model includes the stochasticity inherent in the disease transmission (giving rise to a negative binomial conditional distribution) and random immigration. It is thus a doubly stochastic model for disease dynamics. It further includes seasonality in the transmission rates. All parameters of the model are estimated on the basis of time series data on reported cases and reconstructed susceptible numbers from a set of cities in England and Wales in the prevaccination era (1944–1966). The 60 cities analyzed span a size range from London (3.3 × 106 inhabitants) to Teignmouth (10 500 inhabitants). The dynamics of all cities fit the model well. Transmission rates scale with community size, as expected from dynamics adhering closely to frequency dependent transmission (“true mass action”). These rates are further found to reveal strong seasonal variation, corresponding to high transmission during school terms and lower transmission during the school holidays. The basic reproductive ratio, R0, is found to be invariant across the observed range of host community size, and the mean proportion of susceptible individuals also appears to be constant. Through the epidemic cycle, the susceptible population is kept within a 3\% interval. The disease is, thus, efficient in “regulating” the susceptible population—even in small cities that undergo recurrent epidemics with frequent extinction of the disease agent. Recolonization is highly sensitive to the random immigration process. The initial phase of the epidemic is also stochastic (due to demographic stochasticity and random immigration). However, the epidemic is nearly “deterministic” through most of the growth and decline phase.},

	abstract = {Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus emerged in North America in April 2013 and has since been identified in 30 U.S. States, Canada and Mexico. The rapid spread of {PEDV} has raised concerns about the role of feed and particularly pork-by-product components such as spray-dried porcine plasma ({SDPP}) in {PEDV} transmission. The aim of this study was to determine the infectivity of {PEDV} {RNA} present in commercial {SDPP}. Specifically, 40 3-week-old {PEDV} naïve pigs were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups. At day post inoculation (dpi) 0, {NEG}-{CONTROL} pigs were sham-inoculated, {PEDV}-{CONTROL} pigs received cell culture propagated {PEDV}, and {SDPP}-{CONTROL} pigs were switched to a diet with 5\% {SDPP} containing 5.1±0.1 log10 {PEDV} {RNA} copies/g. To evaluate a potential positive effect of anti-{PEDV} antibodies in {SDPP} on {PEDV} challenge, four days prior to {PEDV} challenge the pigs in the {SDPP}-{PEDV} group were switched to and remained on a 5\% {SDPP} diet through dpi 28. Another group, {EGG}-{PEDV}, was orally administered a commercial egg-derived liquid {PEDV} globulin product from dpi -4 through 6. All {PEDV}-{CONTROL} pigs began shedding {PEDV} in feces by dpi 3 and seroconverted between dpi 7 and 14, whereas pigs in {NEG}-{CONTROL} and {SDPP}-{CONTROL} groups remained {PEDV} {RNA} negative and did not seroconvert to {PEDV} for the study duration. This indicates no evidence of infectivity of the {PEDV} {RNA} in the {SDPP} lot utilized. Furthermore, under the study conditions {SDPP} or egg-derived liquid {PEDV} globulin addition did not significantly alter {PEDV}-shedding or overall disease course after experimental challenge.},

A follow-up epidemiological investigation carried out on the initial and 10 subsequent Ontario {PED} cases pointed to feed as a common risk factor. As a result, several lots of feed and spray-dried porcine plasma ({SDPP}) used as a feed supplement were tested for the presence of {PEDV} genome by real-time {RT}-{PCR} assay. Several of these tested positive, supporting the notion that contaminated feed may have been responsible for the introduction of {PEDV} into Canada. These findings led us to conduct a bioassay experiment in which three {PEDV}-positive {SDPP} samples (from a single lot) and two {PEDV}-positive feed samples supplemented with this {SDPP} were used to orally inoculate 3-week-old piglets. Although the feed-inoculated piglets did not show any significant excretion of {PEDV}, the {SDPP}-inoculated piglets shed {PEDV} at a relatively high level for ≥9 days. Despite the fact that the tested {PEDV} genome positive feed did not result in obvious piglet infection in our bioassay experiment, contaminated feed cannot be ruled out as a likely source of this introduction in the field where many other variables may play a contributing role.},

	abstract = {Globalization has increased the potential for the introduction and spread of novel pathogens over large spatial scales necessitating continental-scale disease models to guide emergency preparedness. Livestock disease spread models, such as those for the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease ({FMD}) epidemic in the United Kingdom, represent some of the best case studies of large-scale disease spread. However, generalization of these models to explore disease outcomes in other systems, such as the United States’s cattle industry, has been hampered by differences in system size and complexity and the absence of suitable livestock movement data. Here, a unique database of {US} cattle shipments allows estimation of synthetic movement networks that inform a near-continental scale disease model of a potential {FMD}-like (i.e., rapidly spreading) epidemic in {US} cattle. The largest epidemics may affect over one-third of the {US} and 120,000 cattle premises, but cattle movement restrictions from infected counties, as opposed to national movement moratoriums, are found to effectively contain outbreaks. Slow detection or weak compliance may necessitate more severe state-level bans for similar control. Such results highlight the role of large-scale disease models in emergency preparedness, particularly for systems lacking comprehensive movement and outbreak data, and the need to rapidly implement multi-scale contingency plans during a potential {US} outbreak.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of infectious diseases that are spread through direct contact have been proven to depend on the strength of community structure or modularity within the underlying network. It has been recently shown that weighted networks with similar modularity values may exhibit different mixing styles regarding the number of connections among communities and their respective weights. However, the effect of mixing style on epidemic behavior was still unclear. In this paper, we simulate the spread of disease within networks with different mixing styles: a dense-weak style (i.e., many edges among the communities with small weights) and a sparse-strong style (i.e., a few edges among the communities with large weights). Simulation results show that, with the same modularity: 1) the mixing style significantly influences the epidemic size, speed, pattern and immunization strategy; 2) the increase of the number of communities amplifies the effect of the mixing style; 3) when the mixing style changes from sparse-strong to dense-weak, there is a ‘saturation point’, after which the epidemic size and pattern become stable. We also provide a mean-field solution of the epidemic threshold and size on weighted community networks with arbitrary external and internal degree distribution. The solution explains the effect of the second moment of the degree distribution, and a symmetric effect of internal and external connections (incl. degree distribution and weight). Our study has both potential significance for designing more accurate metrics for the community structure and exploring diffusion dynamics on metapopulation networks.},

	abstract = {Coronaviruses are known to infect humans and other animals and cause respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. Here we report the emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ({PEDV)} in the United States and determination of its origin, evolution, and genotypes based on temporal and geographical evidence. Histological lesions in small intestine sections of affected pigs and the complete genomic sequences of three emergent strains of {PEDV} isolated from outbreaks in Minnesota and Iowa were characterized. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the three {U.S.} strains revealed a close relationship with Chinese {PEDV} strains and their likely Chinese origin. The {U.S.} {PEDV} strains underwent evolutionary divergence, which can be classified into two sublineages. The three emergent {U.S.} strains are most closely related to a strain isolated in 2012 from Anhui Province in China, which might be the result of multiple recombination events between different genetic lineages or sublineages of {PEDV.} Molecular clock analysis of the divergent time based on the complete genomic sequences is consistent with the actual time difference, approximately 2 to 3 years, of the {PED} outbreaks between China (December 2010) and the United States (May 2013). The finding that the emergent {U.S.} {PEDV} strains share unique genetic features at the 5′-untranslated region with a bat coronavirus provided further support of the evolutionary origin of {PEDV} from bats and potential cross-species transmission. The data from this study have important implications for understanding the ongoing {PEDV} outbreaks in the United States and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures against {PEDV.}
{IMPORTANCE} The sudden emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ({PEDV)}, a coronavirus, for the first time in the United States causes significant economic and public health concerns. Since its recognition in May 2013, {PEDV} has rapidly spread across the United States, resulting in high mortality in piglets in more than 17 States now. The ongoing outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in humans from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula and the historical deadly nature of the 2002 outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus create further anxiety over the emergence of {PEDV} in the United States due to the lack of scientific information about the origin and evolution of this emerging coronavirus. Here we report the detailed genetic characterization, origin, and evolution of emergent {PEDV} strains in the United States. The results provide much needed information to devise effective preventive and control strategies against {PEDV} in the United States.},

	abstract = {Many high level representations of time series have been proposed for data mining, including Fourier transforms, wavelets, eigenwaves, piecewise polynomial models, etc. Many researchers have also considered symbolic representations of time series, noting that such representations would potentiality allow researchers to avail of the wealth of data structures and algorithms from the text processing and bioinformatics communities. While many symbolic representations of time series have been introduced over the past decades, they all suffer from two fatal flaws. First, the dimensionality of the symbolic representation is the same as the original data, and virtually all data mining algorithms scale poorly with dimensionality. Second, although distance measures can be defined on the symbolic approaches, these distance measures have little correlation with distance measures defined on the original time series. In this work we formulate a new symbolic representation of time series. Our representation is unique in that it allows dimensionality/numerosity reduction, and it also allows distance measures to be defined on the symbolic approach that lower bound corresponding distance measures defined on the original series. As we shall demonstrate, this latter feature is particularly exciting because it allows one to run certain data mining algorithms on the efficiently manipulated symbolic representation, while producing identical results to the algorithms that operate on the original data. In particular, we will demonstrate the utility of our representation on various data mining tasks of clustering, classification, query by content, anomaly detection, motif discovery, and visualization.},

Histology revealed severe atrophy of villi in all segments of the small intestines with occasional villus-epithelial syncytial cells, but testing for rotaviruses and Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Alphacoronavirus 1) were negative. Negative-staining electron microscopy of feces revealed coronavirus-like particles and a pan-coronavirus polymerase chain reaction ({PCR)} designed to amplify a conserved region of the polymerase gene for all members in the family Coronaviridae produced expected 251-bp amplicons. Subsequent sequencing and analysis revealed 99.6-100\% identity among the {PCR} amplicons from the 4 farms and 97-99\% identity to the corresponding portion of the polymerase gene of Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ({PEDV)} strains, with the highest identity (99\%) to strains from China in 2012. Findings were corroborated at National Veterinary Services Laboratories using 2 nested S-gene and 1 nested N-gene {PCR} tests where the sequenced amplicons also had the highest identity with 2012 China strains. Whole genome sequence for the virus from 2 farms in 2 different states using next-generation sequencing technique was compared to {PEDV} sequences available in {GenBank.} The 2013 {U.S.} {PEDV} had 96.6-99.5\% identity with all known {PEDV} strains and the highest identity ({\textgreater}99.0\%) to some of the 2011-2012 Chinese strains. The nearly simultaneous outbreaks of disease, and high degree of homology (99.6-100\%) between the {PEDV} strains from the 4 unrelated farms, suggests a common source of virus.},

	abstract = {In recent years, ecologists and epidemiologists have paid increasing attention to the influence of spatial structure in shaping the dynamics and determining the persistence of populations. This is fundamentally affected by the concept of ‘coupling’—the flux of individuals moving between separate populations. In this paper, we contrast how coupling is typically implemented in epidemic models with more detailed approaches. Our aim is to link the popular phenomenological formulations with the results of mechanistic models. By concentrating on the behaviour of simple epidemic systems, we relate explicit movement patterns with observed levels of coupling, validating the standard formulation. The analysis is then extended to include a brief study of how the correlation between stochastic populations is affected by coupling, the underlying deterministic dynamics and the relative population sizes.},

It extends a method previously described in the literature to deal with possible dependence between disease counts from different pathogens. In a spatio-temporal context it is proposed to include additional information on global dispersal of the pathogen in the model. Two examples are given: the first describes an analysis of weekly influenza and meningococcal disease counts from Germany. The second gives an analysis of the spatio-temporal spread of influenza in the {U.S.A.}, 1996–2006, using air traffic information. Maximum likelihood estimates in this non-standard model class are obtained using general optimization routines, which are integrated in the R package surveillance.

In this paper, a non-linear model for the analysis of such multiple time series of counts is discussed. To account for heterogeneous incidence levels or varying transmission of a pathogen across regions, region-specific and possibly spatially correlated random effects are introduced. Inference is based on penalized likelihood methodology for mixed models. Since the use of classical model choice criteria such as {AIC} or {BIC} can be problematic in the presence of random effects, models are compared by means of one-step-ahead predictions and proper scoring rules. In a case study, the model is applied to monthly counts of meningococcal disease cases in 94 departments of France (excluding Corsica) and weekly counts of influenza cases in 140 administrative districts of Southern Germany. The predictive performance improves if existing heterogeneity is accounted for by random effects. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Here for such disease models we consider three assumptions for capturing the network of movements between populations, and focus on two applied problems supported by detailed data from Great Britain: the commuter movement of workers between local areas (wards) and the permanent movement of cattle between farms. For such metapopulation networks, we show that the identity of individuals responsible for making network connections can have a significant impact on the infection dynamics, with clear implications for detailed public health and veterinary applications.},

The combined multiscale nature and intrinsic heterogeneity of the underlying networks make it difficult to develop an intuitive understanding of these processes, to distinguish relevant from peripheral factors, to predict their time course, and to locate their origin. However, we show that complex spatiotemporal patterns can be reduced to surprisingly simple, homogeneous wave propagation patterns, if conventional geographic distance is replaced by a probabilistically motivated effective distance. In the context of global, air-traffic–mediated epidemics, we show that effective distance reliably predicts disease arrival times. Even if epidemiological parameters are unknown, the method can still deliver relative arrival times. The approach can also identify the spatial origin of spreading processes and successfully be applied to data of the worldwide 2009 {H1N1} influenza pandemic and 2003 {SARS} epidemic.
Predicting Disease Dissemination
In combating the global spread of an emerging infectious disease, answers must be obtained to three crucial questions: Where did the disease emerge? Where will it go next? When will it arrive? Brockmann and Helbing (p. 1337; see the Perspective by {McLean)} analyzed disease spread via the “effective distance” rather than geographical distance, wherein two locations that are connected by a strong link are effectively close. The approach was successfully applied to predict disease arrival times or disease source using data from the the 2003 {SARS} viral epidemic, 2009 {H1N1} influenza pandemic, and the 2011 foodborne enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli outbreak in Germany.},

Here, we use influenza-related mortality data to analyze the between-state progression of interpandemic influenza in the United States over the past 30 years. Outbreaks show hierarchical spatial spread evidenced by higher pairwise synchrony between more populous states. Seasons with higher influenza mortality are associated with higher disease transmission and more rapid spread than are mild ones. The regional spread of infection correlates more closely with rates of movement of people to and from their workplaces (workflows) than with geographical distance. Workflows are described in turn by a gravity model, with a rapid decay of commuting up to around 100 km and a long tail of rare longer range flow. A simple epidemiological model, based on the gravity formulation, captures the observed increase of influenza spatial synchrony with transmissibility; high transmission allows influenza to spread rapidly beyond local spatial constraints.},

The 1918 pandemic provides an opportunity to elucidate spatial determinants of spread on a large scale. To better characterize the spread of the 1918 major wave, we fitted a range of city-to-city transmission models to mortality data collected for 246 population centres in England and Wales and 47 cities in the {US.} Using a gravity model for city-to-city contacts, we explored the effect of population size and distance on the spread of disease and tested assumptions regarding density dependence in connectivity between cities. We employed Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to estimate parameters of the model for population, infectivity, distance and density dependence. We inferred the most likely transmission trees for both countries. For England and Wales, a model that estimated the degree of density dependence in connectivity between cities was preferable by deviance information criterion comparison. Early in the major wave, long distance infective interactions predominated, with local infection events more likely as the epidemic became widespread. For the {US}, with fewer more widely dispersed cities, statistical power was lacking to estimate population size dependence or the degree of density dependence, with the preferred model depending on distance only. We find that parameters estimated from the England and Wales dataset can be applied to the {US} data with no likelihood penalty.},

This model uses distance-weighted, population size-dependent coupling to estimate host movement and disease incidence in metapopulations. The model captures overall measles dynamics in terms of underlying human movement in pre-vaccination England and Wales (previously established). In spatial models, edges often present a special challenge. Therefore, to test the model's robustness, we analyzed gravity model incidence predictions for coastal cities in England and Wales. Results show that, although predictions are accurate for inland towns, they significantly underestimate coastal persistence. We examine incidence, outbreak seasonality, and public transportation records, to show that the model's inaccuracies stem from an underestimation of total contacts per individual along the coast. We rescue this predicted ‘edge effect’ by increasing coastal contacts to approximate the number of per capita inland contacts. These results illustrate the impact of ‘edge effects’ on epidemic metapopulations in general and illustrate directions for the refinement of spatiotemporal epidemic models.},

Gravity models, which describe movement fluxes between regions in terms of their populations and distance from each other, have a history of successful use in the geography and economics and are increasingly used in epidemiology. We look at the ability of a range of gravity models to fit human movement data from the {UK} and the {US.} In particular, we compare the behaviour of a simple flu-like epidemic model on synthetic networks generated by fitted gravity models and on the original network present in the data, using time to first infection. For {UK} data, epidemic behaviour on synthetic networks matches that on the original data quite closely. For {US} movement data, synthetic networks perform much worse. We develop an analytic expression for infection time between two regions which indicates that our gravity models fail to capture long range connections between large populations. A model with assortative mixing based on population size greatly improves the match between synthetic and data networks.},

Measles epidemics are one of a few systems documented well enough to reveal all of these properties and how they are affected by spatiotemporal variations in population structure and demography. On the basis of a gravity coupling model and a time series susceptible‐infected‐recovered ({TSIR)} model for local dynamics, we propose a metapopulation model for regional measles dynamics.

Insect foraging has been shown to depend on both the quality of hosts and the distances between hosts. Given the spatial distribution of host plants and individual variation in quality, vector foraging patterns may therefore produce predictable variation in exposure to pathogens. We develop a “gravity” model to describe the spatial spread of a vector‐borne plant pathogen from underlying models of insect foraging in response to host quality using the pollinator‐borne smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum as a case study. We fit the model to spatially explicit time series of M. violaceum transmission in replicate experimental plots of the white campion Silene latifolia. The gravity model provides a better fit than a mean field model or a model with only distance‐dependent transmission. The results highlight the importance of active vector foraging in generating spatial patterns of disease incidence and for pathogen‐mediated selection for floral traits.},

The entities can be individuals or firms and the choices can include housing, jobs, production quantities, exports, imports, face-to-face contacts, schools, retail centres and activity centres. The first {SI} models can be grouped under the generic heading gravity models. Their main characteristic is that they model the behaviour of demand or supply segments, rather than that of individuals and firms. This article traces the development of these models from their inception in the early part of the twentieth century to the present. The key advances include the replacement of the gravity analogy by the more general concepts of entropy or information theory, a statistical framework commonly used in physics. With the arrival of the regional science paradigm over 50 years ago, a key challenge has been to broaden these models compared to those arising in spatial economics, thus arriving at a more inclusive probabilistic framework. These efforts are discussed here, as well as inclusion of geographical advances, embracing activities as generators of travel, time-geography, recognition of spatial interdependencies, and use of neuro-computing principles.},

	abstract = {Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ({PEDV)} was detected in May 2013 for the first time in {US} swine and has since caused significant economic loss. Obtaining a {US} {PEDV} isolate that can grow efficiently in cell culture is critical for investigating the pathogenesis, developing diagnostic assays, and for vaccine development. An additional objective was to determine which gene(s) of {PEDV} is most suitable for studying the genetic relatedness of the virus. Here we describe two {PEDV} isolates ({ISU13-19338E} and {ISU13-22038)} successfully obtained from the small intestines of piglets from sow farms in Indiana and Iowa, respectively. The two isolates have been serially propagated in cell culture for over 30 passages and been characterized for the first 10 passages. Virus production in cell culture was confirmed by {PEDV-specific} real-time {RT-PCR}, immunofluorescence assay, and electron microscopy. The infectious titers of the viruses during the first 10 passages ranged from 6×102 to 2×105 {TCID50/ml.} In addition, the full-length genome sequences of six viruses ({ISU13-19338E} homogenate, P3, P9; {ISU13-22038} homogenate, P3, P9) were determined. Genetically the two {PEDV} isolates were relatively stable during the first 10 passages in cell culture. Sequences were also compared to 4 additional {US} {PEDV} strains and 23 non-{US} strains. All {US} {PEDV} strains were genetically closely related to each other (≥99.7\% nucleotide identity), and most genetically similar to Chinese strains reported in 2011-2012. Phylogenetic analyses using different genes of {PEDV} suggested that the full-length spike gene or the S1 portion is appropriate for sequencing to study the genetic relatedness of these viruses.},

	abstract = {Background. Defining dispersal of influenza virus via aerosol is essential for the development of prevention measures.
Methods. During the 2010–2011 influenza season, subjects with influenza-like illness were enrolled in an emergency department and throughout a tertiary care hospital, nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained, and symptom severity, treatment, and medical history were recorded. Quantitative impaction air samples were taken not ≤0.305 m (1 foot), 0.914 m (3 feet), and 1.829 m (6 feet) from the patient's head during routine care. Influenza virus was detected by rapid test and polymerase chain reaction.
Results. Sixty-one of 94 subjects (65\%) tested positive for influenza virus. Twenty-six patients (43\%) released influenza virus into room air, with 5 (19\%) emitting up to 32 times more virus than others. Emitters surpassed the airborne 50\% human infectious dose of influenza virus at all sample locations. Healthcare professionals ({HCPs)} were exposed to mainly small influenza virus particles (diameter, {\textless}4.7 µm), with concentrations decreasing with increasing distance from the patient's head (P {\textless} .05). Influenza virus release was associated with high viral loads in nasopharyngeal samples (shedding), coughing, and sneezing (P {\textless} .05). Patients who reported severe illness and major interference with daily life also emitted more influenza virus (P {\textless} .05).
Conclusions. {HCPs} within 1.829 m of patients with influenza could be exposed to infectious doses of influenza virus, primarily in small-particle aerosols. This finding questions the current paradigm of localized droplet transmission during non–aerosol-generating procedures.},

Such a data structure is typical in social network studies, where variables indicate some type of relation between a given set of actors. We present a new permutation method (called “double semi-partialing”, or {DSP)} that complements the family of extant approaches to {MRQAP} tests. We assess the statistical bias (type I error rate) and statistical power of the set of five methods, including {DSP}, across a variety of conditions of network autocorrelation, of spuriousness (size of confounder effect), and of skewness in the data. These conditions are explored across three assumed data distributions: normal, gamma, and negative binomial. We find that the {Freedman–Lane} method and the {DSP} method are the most robust against a wide array of these conditions. We also find that all five methods perform better if the test statistic is pivotal. Finally, we find limitations of usefulness for {MRQAP} tests: All tests degrade under simultaneous conditions of extreme skewness and high spuriousness for gamma and negative binomial distributions.},

	abstract = {Summary. We propose the elastic net, a new regularization and variable selection method. Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p≫n case. An algorithm called {LARS-EN} is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm {LARS} does for the lasso.},

Histology revealed severe atrophy of villi in all segments of the small intestines with occasional villus-epithelial syncytial cells, but testing for rotaviruses and Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Alphacoronavirus 1) were negative. Negative-staining electron microscopy of feces revealed coronavirus-like particles and a pan-coronavirus polymerase chain reaction ({PCR)} designed to amplify a conserved region of the polymerase gene for all members in the family Coronaviridae produced expected 251-bp amplicons. Subsequent sequencing and analysis revealed 99.6-100\% identity among the {PCR} amplicons from the 4 farms and 97-99\% identity to the corresponding portion of the polymerase gene of Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ({PEDV)} strains, with the highest identity (99\%) to strains from China in 2012. Findings were corroborated at National Veterinary Services Laboratories using 2 nested S-gene and 1 nested N-gene {PCR} tests where the sequenced amplicons also had the highest identity with 2012 China strains. Whole genome sequence for the virus from 2 farms in 2 different states using next-generation sequencing technique was compared to {PEDV} sequences available in {GenBank.} The 2013 {U.S.} {PEDV} had 96.6-99.5\% identity with all known {PEDV} strains and the highest identity ({\textgreater}99.0\%) to some of the 2011-2012 Chinese strains. The nearly simultaneous outbreaks of disease, and high degree of homology (99.6-100\%) between the {PEDV} strains from the 4 unrelated farms, suggests a common source of virus.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneity in host contact patterns profoundly shapes population-level disease dynamics. Many epidemiological models make simplifying assumptions about the patterns of disease-causing interactions among hosts. In particular, homogeneous-mixing models assume that all hosts have identical rates of disease-causing contacts. In recent years, several network-based approaches have been developed to explicitly model heterogeneity in host contact patterns. Here, we use a network perspective to quantify the extent to which real populations depart from the homogeneous-mixing assumption, in terms of both the underlying network structure and the resulting epidemiological dynamics. We find that human contact patterns are indeed more heterogeneous than assumed by homogeneous-mixing models, but are not as variable as some have speculated. We then evaluate a variety of methodologies for incorporating contact heterogeneity, including network-based models and several modifications to the simple {SIR} compartmental model. We conclude that the homogeneous-mixing compartmental model is appropriate when host populations are nearly homogeneous, and can be modified effectively for a few classes of non-homogeneous networks. In general, however, network models are more intuitive and accurate for predicting disease spread through heterogeneous host populations.},

Instead of presenting isolated techniques, this text emphasizes problem solving strategies that address the many issues arising when developing multivariable models using real data and not standard textbook examples. It includes imputation methods for dealing with missing data effectively, methods for dealing with nonlinear relationships and for making the estimation of transformations a formal part of the modeling process, methods for dealing with "too many variables to analyze and not enough observations," and powerful model validation techniques based on the bootstrap. This text realistically deals with model uncertainty and its effects on inference to achieve "safe data mining".},

	abstract = {Summary.  Estimation of structure, such as in variable selection, graphical modelling or cluster analysis, is notoriously difficult, especially for high dimensional data. We introduce stability selection. It is based on subsampling in combination with (high dimensional) selection algorithms. As such, the method is extremely general and has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularization for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection is applied. We prove for the randomized lasso that stability selection will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions for consistency of the original lasso method are violated. We demonstrate stability selection for variable selection and Gaussian graphical modelling, using real and simulated data.},

	abstract = {Anticipating infectious disease emergence and documenting progress in disease elimination are important applications for the theory of critical transitions. A key problem is the development of theory relating the dynamical processes of transmission to observable phenomena. In this paper, we consider compartmental susceptible–infectious–susceptible ({SIS}) and susceptible–infectious–recovered ({SIR}) models that are slowly forced through a critical transition. We derive expressions for the behavior of several candidate indicators, including the autocorrelation coefficient, variance, coefficient of variation, and power spectra of {SIS} and {SIR} epidemics during the approach to emergence or elimination. We validated these expressions using individual-based simulations. We further showed that moving-window estimates of these quantities may be used for anticipating critical transitions in infectious disease systems. Although leading indicators of elimination were highly predictive, we found the approach to emergence to be much more difficult to detect. It is hoped that these results, which show the anticipation of critical transitions in infectious disease systems to be theoretically possible, may be used to guide the construction of online algorithms for processing surveillance data.},

	abstract = {Author Summary
Since 1998, genetically and antigenically diverse influenza A viruses have circulated in North American swine due to continuous cross-species transmission and reassortment with avian and human influenza viruses, presenting a pandemic threat to humans. Millions of swine are transported year-round from the southern United States into the corn-rich Midwest, but the importance of these movements in the spatial dissemination and evolution of the influenza virus in swine is unknown. Using a large data set of influenza virus sequences collected in North American swine during 2003–2010, we investigated the spatial dynamics of two influenza viruses of the H1 subtype that were introduced into swine from humans around 2003. Employing recently developed Bayesian phylogeography methods, we find that the spread of this influenza virus follows the large-scale transport of swine from the South to the Midwest. Based on this pattern of viral migration, we suggest that the genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses in the Midwest is continually augmented by the importation of viruses from source populations located in the South. Understanding the importance of long-distance pig movements in the evolution and spatial dissemination of influenza virus in swine may inform future strategies for the surveillance and control of influenza, and perhaps other swine pathogens.},
