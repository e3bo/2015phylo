* Introduction

** Present flashy examples of what has been done with phylogeography to whet appetite

* High-level survey of available methods

** Describe in more detail the parsimony analysis of influenza sequences



** Explains problems identified by discrete phylogeography paper

** Explain solutions proposed, some of the results found with them

** Describe the problem with applying these approaches to data with long-lats instead of discrete locations

** Describe solution proposed, examples of results found with them

** describe the further analysis possible with the seraphim package

* Modeling approaches for the population dynamics

** describe the ODE framework of volz

** describe the structured coalescent

** describe the basta approximation of dimao et al.


** Point out that the continuous approaches have a clearer model for the population dynamics than the discrete ones

** describe the birth-death model of stadler et al.

* Proposed new approach

** explain that fitting any of these models to data may pose a variable selection problem

** explain the penalized likelihood approach to simultaneously performing variables selection and fitting model

** explain how this approach could be generalized to use a convex log-likelihood function in place of that of an exponential family model

** explain the LHAC algorithm for fitting such a model with an L1 penalty

** walk though the process of analysing a real data set with this approach

** reiterate the advantages of this approach

** explain what I think needs further work to complete it, solicit feedback

* Conclusion
